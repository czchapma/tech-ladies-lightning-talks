					<p>Tech Ladies is a community for cis women, trans women, and nonbinary people. We urge our members to not assume the pronouns of others. While many of our members use she/her, for example, some use they/them. Remember not to judge people’s gender based on their photos or names they use on Facebook.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<p>This is a place for all women who are interested in working in tech. Whether you have a job in tech, are seeking a job in tech, or have a job in tech that is not typically thought of as "technical" (such as marketing, business development, design, UX/UI, research, etc.), <strong>you are welcome here. This group is for you.</strong> </p>

					<p>Discussions, posts, actions, or comments that <strong>promote hatred of any kind</strong> - including, but not limited to, racism, sexism, transphobia, homophobia, biphobia, queerphobia, ableism, and ageism - are not acceptable in Tech Ladies spaces and may result in you being removed from online or in-person spaces.</p>

					<p><strong>If a member promotes violence or hatred, an admin will warn them about their behavior.</strong> Ideally, we want that person to recognize the impact of their actions and follow that up with clear behavioral changes. <strong>If there is a second strike,</strong> we will remove that person from our community. Certain egregious violations - such as threatening harm toward another member or harassing another member - may result in removal without a warning. <strong>The admins reserve the right to make that judgement without discussion if needed.</strong></p>
